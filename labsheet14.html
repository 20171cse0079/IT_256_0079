Sharma was raised in Bangalore.[2] She was educated at the Army School there, and received a degree in arts from Mount Carmel College.[7][8] She originally intended to pursue a career in modelling or journalism, and had no aspirations to be an actress.[7] After graduation, Sharma moved to Mumbai to further her modelling career.[9] She enrolled herself at the Elite Model Management, and was groomed by the style consultant Prasad Bidapa.[10] In 2007, Sharma made her runway debut at the Lakme Fashion Week for designer Wendell Rodricks's Les Vamps Show and was picked to be his finale model at the Spring Summer 2007 Collection.[9] Since then she has done campaigns for the brands Silk & Shine, Whisper, Nathella Jewelry and Fiat Palio.[10] Sharma later said, "I think I was born to emote and act. I would walk down the ramp and smile and they used to say, 'give us a blank look.' It was really difficult, not to smile".[9] Whilst modelling, Sharma also joined an acting school and began auditioning for film roles.

Sharma made her acting debut in Aditya Chopra's romantic drama Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi (2008), opposite Shah Rukh Khan. She took a day to prepare for her screen test at the Yash Raj Films studio and refused to do an impromptu one.[9] She was signed for a three-film deal with the company and landed the leading role of Tani Sahni, a young bride to a middle-aged man, portrayed by Khan. Khalid Mohamed of Hindustan Times found her to be "assured and upright" in the film,[13] but Nikhat Kazmi thought that she "lacks all chutzpah and can barely hold your attention".[14] The film was a major commercial success, emerging as the second-highest grossing Hindi film of that year,[15] and earned Sharma Filmfare Award nominations for Best Actress and Best Female Debut.[16] Two years later, Sharma played the leading lady in the crime-comedy Badmaash Company, directed by Parmeet Sethi and co-starring Shahid Kapoor, Vir Das and Meiyang Chang. The film, which tells the story of four underachieving friends who begin a scam business enterprise, received mixed reviews.[17]
